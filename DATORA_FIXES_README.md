# Datora Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the Datora integration issues on the Creamy Fabrics Shopify theme.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Datora Script Loading
**Problem**: Script was not loading efficiently and could be loaded multiple times.
**Solution**: 
- Added proper async loading in `theme.liquid` before `</head>`
- Added check to prevent duplicate loading
- Added preconnect for better performance

### 2. Influencer Discount Code Persistence
**Problem**: Discount codes from influencer links (e.g., `https://creamyfabrics.com/discount/xyztoni?redirect=/collections/bestseller`) were not persisting across page loads.

**Solution**:
- Created dedicated `influencer-discount-handler.liquid` snippet
- Implements localStorage-based persistence
- Automatically reapplies discount codes when navigating between pages
- Handles redirect functionality properly

### 3. Mobile PDP Discount Code Application
**Problem**: On mobile product detail pages, discount codes weren't applying properly due to AJAX content loading.

**Solution**:
- Added mobile-specific handling in the influencer discount handler
- Implements MutationObserver to detect AJAX content changes
- Automatically reapplies discount codes after content loads
- Includes proper error handling and retry logic

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Multiple scripts loading in head affecting page speed.

**Solution**:
- Made Datora script async
- Added preconnect for CDN
- Optimized script loading order
- Implemented proper error handling to prevent blocking

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`layout/theme.liquid`**
   - Added proper Datora script loading with async attribute
   - Added preconnect for performance
   - Included influencer discount handler snippet

2. **`snippets/datora-js.liquid`**
   - Enhanced error handling for co2 object availability
   - Added localStorage integration for discount persistence
   - Improved mobile PDP handling
   - Added proper event dispatching for discount removal

3. **`snippets/influencer-discount-handler.liquid`** (New)
   - Comprehensive discount code management
   - URL parameter handling
   - Cart attribute persistence
   - Mobile-specific optimizations
   - AJAX content change detection

### How It Works

#### Influencer Link Flow
1. User visits: `https://creamyfabrics.com/discount/xyztoni?redirect=/collections/bestseller`
2. Script saves discount code and redirect path to localStorage
3. Shopify applies the discount and redirects to `/collections/bestseller`
4. On subsequent page loads, script checks if discount is still active
5. If not active, automatically reapplies the discount

#### Mobile PDP Flow
1. User navigates to product page on mobile
2. Script detects mobile device and product page
3. Waits for AJAX content to load (1 second delay)
4. Checks if saved discount is applied
5. If not, automatically applies the discount
6. Updates cart and triggers price updates

#### Performance Optimizations
- Async script loading prevents blocking
- Preconnect improves CDN connection speed
- Error handling prevents script failures
- Proper event management reduces unnecessary operations

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Influencer Link Test**
   - Visit: `https://creamyfabrics.com/discount/xyztoni?redirect=/collections/bestseller`
   - Verify discount is applied
   - Navigate to different pages
   - Verify discount persists

2. **Mobile PDP Test**
   - Visit product page on mobile
   - Apply discount code
   - Navigate away and back
   - Verify discount is still applied

3. **Performance Test**
   - Check page load speed
   - Verify Datora script loads asynchronously
   - Confirm no blocking scripts

### Browser Console Logs

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
- `[Influencer Discount]` prefixed messages for debugging
- Error handling with console.error for issues
- Success confirmations for discount applications

## SEO Considerations

- All changes maintain existing SEO structure
- No impact on meta tags or page structure
- Scripts load asynchronously to preserve Core Web Vitals
- No changes to existing content or markup

## Maintenance

### Future Updates
- Monitor Datora CDN URL for changes
- Update script URL if needed
- Test influencer links regularly
- Monitor mobile performance metrics

### Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for `[Influencer Discount]` messages
- Verify localStorage contains discount codes
- Test cart API responses
- Monitor Datora co2 object availability
